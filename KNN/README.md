## KNN study note

Pick the tabel which is of highest frequence <b/>
from K nearest  neighbors 

## File to matrix
listdir

## Distance metric:
1. euclidean distance
...

## Normalization
norm = value / (minValue - maxValue)

## Pros and cons
Pros: <b/>
- Simple to implement<b/>
- Flexible to feature / distance choices<b/>
- Naturally handles multi-class cases<b/>
- Can do well in practice with enough representative data<b/>

Cons:<b/>
- Large search problem to find nearest neighbors<b/>
- Storage of data<b/>
- Meaningful distance function<b/>
- Computational cost, space cost too high<b/>

## Suitable data
Numeric and Nominal type data

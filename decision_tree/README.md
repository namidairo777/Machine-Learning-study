## Decision tree

flow step:
1. Data collection:
	
2. Preparing data:

3. Analyzing data

4. Training algorithm

5. Testing algorithm

6. Application to algorithm

## Information gain & entropy
(Also we have <b>Gini impurity</b>)

## Recursion to create tree
Based on the best attribute (highest info gain), split the data set.
The feature value may be more than two,so splition may be more than 2 branches.
Then do recursion
Recursion stop condition: iterates all attributes, or children of a branch are all same classification
